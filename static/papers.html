                            Computational reproducibility depends on the ability to not only isolate necessary and sufficient computational artifacts
                            but also to preserve those artifacts for later re-execution. Both isolation and preservation
                            present challenges in large part due to the complexity of existing software and systems as well
                            as the implicit dependencies, resource distribution, and shifting compatibility of systScience
                            projects are increasingly investing in computational reproducibility. Constructing software pipelines
                            to demonstrate reproducibility is also becoming increasingly common. To aid the process of constructing
                            pipelines, science project members often adopt reproducible methods and tools. One such tool
                            is CDE, which is a software packaging tool that encapsulates source code, datasets and environments.
                            However, CDE does not include information about origins of dependencies. Consequently when multiple
                            CDE packages are combined and merged to create a software pipeline, several issues arise requiring
                            an author to manually verify compatibility of distributions, environment variables, software
                            dependencies and compiler options. In this work, we propose software provenance to be included
                            as part of CDE so that resulting provenance-included CDE packages can be easily used for creating
                            software pipelines. We describe provenance attributes that must be included and how they can
                            be efficiently stored in a light-weight CDE package. Furthermore, we show how a provenance in
                            a package can be used for creating software pipelines and maintained as new packages are created.
                            We experimentally evaluate the overhead of auditing and maintaining provenance and compare with
                            heavy weight approaches for reproducibility such as virtualization. Our experiments indicate
                            minimal overheads. ems that result over time ‚Äùall of which conspire to break the reproducibility

                            in order to isolate computational artifacts. Several tools were proposed recently that employ
                            sandboxing as a mechanism to ensure reproducibility. However, none of these tools preserve the

                            crucial for ensuring reproducibility as sandboxing itself. In this paper, we describe a framework
                            of com- bined sandboxing and preservation, which is not only efficient and invariant, but also
                            practical for large-scale reproducibility. We present case studies of complex high-energy physics
                            applications and show how the framework can be useful for sandboxing, preserving, and distributing
                            applications. We report on the completeness, performance, and efficiency of the framework, and
                            suggest possible standardization approches.

                            We present a light-weight database virtualization (LDV) system that allows users to share and re-execute applications that
                            operate on a relational database (DB). Previous methods for sharing DB applications, such as
                            companion websites and virtual machine images (VMIs), support neither easy and efficient re-execution
                            nor the sharing of only a relevant DB subset. LDV addresses these issues by monitoring application
                            execution, including DB operations, and using the resulting execution trace to create a lightweight
                            re-executable package. A LDV package includes, in addition to the application, either the DB
                            management system (DBMS) and relevant data or, if the DBMS and/or data cannot be shared, just
                            the application-DBMS communications for replay during re-execution. We introduce a linked DB-operating
                            system provenance model and show how to infer data dependencies based on temporal information
                            about the DB operations performed by the application's process(es). We use this model to determine
                            the DB subset that needs to be included in a package in order to enable re-execution. We compare
                            LDV with other sharing methods in terms of package size, monitoring overhead, and re-execution
                            overhead. We show that LDV packages are often more than an order of magnitude smaller than a
                            VMI for the same application, and have negligible re-execution overhead.

                            Prior to the computational-driven revolution in science, research papers provided the pri-mary mechanism for sharing novel
                            methods and data. Papers described experiments involving small amount of data, derivations on
                            that data, and associated methods and algorithms. Readers reproduced the results by repeating
                            the physical experiment, performing hand calculation, and/or logical argument. The scientific
                            method in this decade has become decisively computational, involving large quantities of data,
                            complex data manipulation tasks, and large, and often distributed, software stacks. The research
                            paper, in its current text form, is only able to summarize the associated data and computation
                            rather than reproduce it computationally. While papers corroborate descriptions through indirect
                            means, such as by building companion websites that share data and software packages, these external
                            websites continue to remain disconnected from the content within the paper, making it difficult
                            to verify claims and reproduce results. There is an critical need for systems that minimize this
                            disconnect. We describe Science Object Linking and Embedding (SOLE), a framework for creating
                            descriptive and interactive publications by linking them with associated science objects, such
                            as source codes, datasets, annotations, workflows, re-playable packages, and virtual machine
                            images. SOLE provides a suite of tools that assist the author to create and host science objects
                            that can then be linked with research papers for the purpose of assessment, repeatability, and
                            verification of research. The framework also creates a linkable representation of the science
                            object with the publication and manages a bibliography-like specification of science objects.
                            In this chapter, we introduce SOLE, and describe its use for augmenting the content of computation-based
                            scientific publications. We present examples from climate science, chemistry, biology, and computer
                            science.

                            It has become increasingly important to capture and understand the origins and derivation of data (its provenance). A key
                            issue in evaluating the feasibility of data provenance is its performance, overheads, and scalability.
                            In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a general metadata storage and management layer
                            for parallel file systems, in which metadata includes both file operations and provenance metadata.
                            We experimentally investigate the design optimality whether provenance metadata should be loosely-coupled
                            or tightly integrated with a file metadata storage systems. We consider two systems that have
                            applied sim- ilar distributed concepts to metadata management, but focusing singularly on kind
                            of metadata: (i) FusionFS, which implements a distributed file metadata management based on distributed
                            hash tables, and (ii) SPADE, which uses a graph database to store audited provenance data and
                            provides distributed module for querying provenance. Our results on a 32-node cluster show that
                            FusionFS+SPADE is a promising prototype with negligible provenance overhead and has promise to
                            scale to petascale and beyond. Furthermore, FusionFS with its own storage layer for provenance
                            capture is able to scale up to 1K nodes on BlueGene/P supercomputer.

                            We present Provenance-to-use (PTU), a tool that minimizes computation time during repeatability testing. Authors can use
                            PTU to build a package of their software program and include a provenance trace of an initial,
                            reference execution. Testers can perform a partial deterministic replay of the package by choosing
                            a subset of the processes based on the process√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ compute, memory and I/O utilization obtained
                            during the reference execution. Using the provenance trace, PTU guarantees that events are processed
                            in the same order using the same data from one execution to the next. We show the efficiency
                            of PTU for conducting repeatability testing of workflow-based scientific programs.

                        <p class="paper-abstract">Users can determine the precise origins of their data by collecting detailed provenance records.
                            However, auditing at a finer grain produces large amounts of metadata. To efficiently manage
                            the collected provenance, several provenance management systems, including SPADE, record provenance
                            on the hosts where it is gen- erated. Distributed provenance raises the issue of efficient reconstruction
                            during the query phase. Recursively querying provenance metadata or computing its transitive
                            closure is known to have limited scalability and cannot be used for large provenance graphs.
                            We present matrix filters, which are novel data structures for representing graph information,
                            and demonstrate their utility for improving query efficiency with experiments on provenance metadata
                            gathered while executing distributed workflow applications.

                            of sources from which data now originates, the diversity of the individual manipulations performed,
                            and the complexity of the orchestrations of these operations all limit the reproducibility that
                            a scientist can ensure solely by manually recording their actions.

                        <p class="paper-abstract">Current provenance collection systems typically gather metadata on remote hosts and submit it to
                            a central server. In contrast, several data-intensive scientific applications require a decentralized
                            architecture in which each host maintains an authoritative local repository of the provenance
                            metadata gathered on that host. The latter approach allows the system to handle the large amounts
                            of metadata generated when auditing occurs at fine granularity, and allows users to retain control
                            over their provenance records. The decentralized architecture,however, increases the complexity
                            of auditing, tracking, and querying distributed provenance. We describe a system for capturing
                            data provenance in distributed applications, and the use of provenance sketches to optimize subsequent
                            data provenance queries. Experiments with data gathered from distributed work√Ø¬¨‚Äöow applications
                            demonstrate the feasibility of a decentralized provenance management system and improvements
                            in the efficiency of provenance queries
