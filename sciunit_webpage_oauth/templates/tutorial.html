<h1>A Brief Introduction to Sciunit</h1>
<p>From time to time, you may find that it is hard to verify or reproduce someone
else&rsquo;s research, even though it is only programs, data, and output.
Programs may be built in different ways, may behave differently if not running
in the author&rsquo;s environment, and can accept different arguments at runtime.
All these factors contribute to the difficulties of trying out others&rsquo; work.
How about, starting from your next paper, you publish the article along with a
&ldquo;sciunit&rdquo; research object to encapsulate all the workflows you plan to
demonstrate, allowing your readers and reviewer to try out your work?</p>
<h2 id="doc-Create">Basic concepts</h2>
<h3>Sciunit</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sciunit&rdquo; is both the name of the reusable research object we defined and also
the name of command-line tool that creates, manages, and shares <em>sciunits</em>.  A
sciunit consists of multiple <em>executions</em>.  Each execution refers to an
execution of a command under Linux.  The command may be a single binary, may
start with the name of a specific virtual machine for managed languages, such
as &ldquo;java,&rdquo; or may be a shell script that contains multiple commands. An
execution may also be a series of terminal inputs that capture your
interaction with a UNIX shell. In all cases, the execution have its runtime
dependencies determined during an &ldquo;auditing&rdquo; phase, saved to a sciunit, and
can be &ldquo;repeated&rdquo; later on a different machine without pulling in any
dependencies of the execution.</p>
<p>Each execution is assigned an execution id, starting from <code>e1</code>.  In your
paper, you describe each workflow you want to discuss and reference it using
its corresponding execution id in a sciunit &ndash; just like referencing a figure
using a numerical figure id.</p>
<h3>Workspace</h3>
<p>The <em>sciunit</em>(1) command-line tool owns the directory <code>~/sciunit</code>.  A
workspace for a sciunit is a subdirectory under <code>~/sciunit</code>.  The command</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sciunit create Project1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>creates and opens an empty sciunit called &ldquo;Project1,&rdquo; where
<code>~/sciunit/Project1</code> is its workspace.  You can verify these with</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit show
sciunit: show: sciunit <span class="s1">&#39;Project1&#39;</span> is empty
</pre></div>


<p>You can switch among multiple workspaces with the <code>open</code> command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sciunit open Project2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also load a sciunit into a workspace and then open it.  The following
chapters describe more forms of the <code>open</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="doc-Capture">Capturing and testing your program</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program in a shell script.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; cat hello.sh
<span class="c1">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello, world&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can run this program</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; ./hello.sh
hello, world
</pre></div>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s try to capture this program with <code>sciunit</code>.  Assume that we just
created a new sciunit called &ldquo;Project1.&rdquo;  Rerun the program with <code>sciunit
exec</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit <span class="nb">exec</span> ./hello.sh
hello, world
</pre></div>


<p>Now this program, along with its all its dependencies, has been captured as
<code>e1</code> in &ldquo;Project1.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;show&rdquo; command can display the details of the last
captured execution:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit show
     id: e1
sciunit: Project1
command: ./hello.sh
   size: <span class="m">2</span>.82 MB
started: <span class="m">2017</span>-10-10 <span class="m">08</span>:42
</pre></div>


<p>As we claimed, this execution can be repeated on a different machine.  We will
do so in the remaining chapters, but before that, we should test it locally:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit repeat e1
hello, world
</pre></div>


<p>If you investigate the workspace</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; ls ~/sciunit/Project1/
cde-package  e1.json  sciunit.db  vvpkg.bin  vvpkg.db
</pre></div>


<p>, you will find a directory named &ldquo;cde-package&rdquo; and a few other files.  The
&ldquo;cde-package&rdquo; is a temporary directory that consists of all necessary files
for this execution to repeat; for example, you can even find a &ldquo;libc.so.6&rdquo;
somewhere under this directory.  The rest of the files are the underlying
implementation of the conceptual &ldquo;sciunit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s try a different way to capture an execution &ndash; capture as you go:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit <span class="nb">exec</span> -i
Interactive capturing started<span class="p">;</span> press Ctrl-D to end
&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>Wait, that&rsquo;s it?  No, you are merely inside a subshell: all the commands you
run from now on will be captured.  For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello&#39;</span>
hello
&gt; ./hello.sh
hello, world
</pre></div>


<p>Now press &ldquo;Ctrl-D&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; <span class="nb">exit</span>
Interactive capturing ended
</pre></div>


<p>These commands all become execution <code>e2</code>, and you can repeat it as well.</p>
<p>So far, we created two executions within the sciunit.  You can list them with
the <code>list</code> command</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit list
   e1 Oct <span class="m">10</span> <span class="m">08</span>:42 ./hello.sh
   e2 Oct <span class="m">10</span> <span class="m">11</span>:00
</pre></div>


<p>, or remove one of them with the <code>rm</code> command.  Note that after a removal all
the remaining executions retain their current execution ids, and new
executions will be assigned ids which are higher than the remaining ones.</p>
<h2 id="doc-Copy">Continue your work on another machine</h2>
<p>While developing your paper, you might want to capture more executions on
another machine, testing your sciunit in another environment, or maybe share
the sciunit with a coauthor.  Conceptually, you want to copy &amp; paste,
remotely.  The easiest way is to use the <code>copy</code> command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit copy
mSLLTj#
</pre></div>


<p>Give it a second, and it returns a code.  You can then &ldquo;paste&rdquo; the sciunit
over the Internet by running</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sciunit open mSLLTj#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>on the target machine.  The heavy lifting utilizes the
<a href="https://file.io">file.io</a> service.  The code is only valid for one day.  Once
pasted, the code is gone.</p>
<p>If you investigate the <code>~/sciunit</code> directory on the machine in which you
initiated the copy,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; ls ~/sciunit
Project1  Project1.zip
</pre></div>


<p>you will find a new zip file.  As you can imagine, it is a zipped version of
the sciunit &ldquo;Project1.&rdquo;  The <code>open</code> command can also open a zipped sciunit.
So if you do not want to use <a href="https://file.io">file.io</a>, you can instead use
the <code>sciunit copy -n</code> command to generate this file, and deliver the file to
some other machine or to someone else.</p>
<h2 id="doc-Publish">Prepare your paper for review</h2>
<p>The zip file mentioned above is the research object you are going to publish
along with your paper.  You can manually select and upload such a file on
websites that host sharing of research objects, however, if you are using
<a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/">HydroShare</a>, maintaining and updating your draft
articles can be drastically simplified with the <em>sciunit</em>(1) tool.</p>
<p>Issue the following command to create a new article for the current sciunit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sciunit push my_new_article --setup hs</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;my_new_article&rdquo; is a codename for your article.  Codenames are useful for
maintaining multiple articles you created from the same sciunit, and you
should pick a codename that describes an article&rsquo;s use, such as &ldquo;debug.&rdquo;  &ldquo;hs&rdquo;
is short for &ldquo;hydroshare&rdquo; to indicate the service you are talking to.</p>
<p>The above command prompts you for</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Please go to the following link and authorize access:

https://www.hydroshare.org/o/authorize/?response_type=code&amp;client_id=vG5R4zZFO6uJZBj3m0DWtUK6Va44jTQ4KoqtaLpn&amp;redirect_uri=https:%2F%2Fsciunit.run%2Fcb&amp;state=RCeAb6zxbEuw6yHQPDpWu26iHQIcan

Paste the authorization code:
</pre></div>


<p>Here we are running OAuth2 flow for HydroShare.  After you have authorized
the <em>sciunit</em> tool in a web browser and pasted in the auth code,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Paste the authorization code: AoxTbXnjzTfIa3OP5d5unxImPn0Noc
Logged in as &quot;Yuan, Zhihao &lt;lichray@gmail.com&gt;&quot;
Title for the new article: New Article for Project1
new: 8.93MB [00:01, 4.72MB/s]
</pre></div>


<p>input the title for the article and wait for the upload to finish.  Now you
can go to <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/my-resources/">https://www.hydroshare.org/my-resources/</a> to view your new article
on HydroShare.  A newly-created article lacks information for publication and
is private.</p>
<p>After each successful &ldquo;push,&rdquo; the codename involved is recorded for the next</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sciunit push</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>command to pick up.  So after you make a few changes to the current sciunit,
such as capturing a new execution, the above command can silently keep your
article on HydroShare up-to-date.  However, if you run</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>&gt; sciunit push my_new_article --setup hs
Logged in as <span class="s2">&quot;Yuan, Zhihao &lt;lichray@gmail.com&gt;&quot;</span>
Create a new version of the article <span class="s2">&quot;New Article for Project1&quot;</span>? <span class="o">[</span>y/N<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>again, you are creating another new article rather than updating the existing
one.  If you answer &lsquo;<code>y</code>&rsquo;, the article will be a new &ldquo;version&rdquo; (HydroShare
feature) of the existing one; if you answer &lsquo;<code>n</code>&rsquo;, the new article can have a
different title.  In case you accidentally run into this query and cannot
answer it, just press &ldquo;Ctrl-D&rdquo; to cancel the operation.</p>
